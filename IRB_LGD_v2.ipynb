    "> **Note:** This project uses artificially generated data, parameters, and conversion factors, all created by me. It is intended solely as part of a job application to demonstrate the level of my expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a full end-to-end pipeline for **Loss Given Default (LGD)** modeling within the **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB)** framework. The goal is to demonstrate a structured, transparent, and regulatory-aligned approach to modeling credit loss severity while applying practical data science principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data quality review and exploratory analysis of exposure and recovery patterns  \n",
    "- Feature engineering informed by credit risk domain knowledge  \n",
    "- Pipeline construction for imputation, encoding, scaling, and model training  \n",
    "- LGD estimation using multiple modeling approaches: linear regression, random forest, and classification-based techniques  \n",
    "- Performance evaluation via R², RMSE, classification metrics, residual analysis, and prediction calibration  \n",
    "- Structured validation using a traffic-light assessment framework  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and suitable for deployment in production environments. The modular, pipeline-based approach supports clean data handling and reduces the risk of data leakage or model instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was developed independently to reflect both technical proficiency and a sound understanding of regulatory credit risk modeling practices, particularly in estimating LGD as part of the IRB framework.\n"

    "# 1. Theory and Background: Credit Risk – Loss Given Default (LGD)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the core concepts of **Loss Given Default (LGD)** within the context of credit risk and Basel regulation. We explain what LGD is, its role in the IRB framework, what factors influence it, and how it is commonly estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key distinction is between **Point-in-Time (PiT)** and **Through-the-Cycle (TTC)** estimates. The IRB approach primarily relies on PiT parameters, meaning PD, LGD, and EAD reflect current economic and borrower-specific conditions. This makes the models more sensitive to market changes, requiring more frequent updates and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is LGD?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Given Default (LGD)** represents the portion of an exposure that a lender expects to lose if a borrower defaults. It reflects recovery from collateral, legal processes, and any payments collected post-default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If a bank has an exposure of €100,000 and expects to recover €30,000 after default:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{LGD} = \\frac{100,000 - 30,000}{100,000} = 70\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Time Horizon and Regulatory Context\n",
    "\n",
    "LGD is often modeled as **downturn LGD**, meaning it reflects losses under adverse economic conditions. This ensures that capital requirements remain conservative even during stress scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the Advanced IRB approach, banks are responsible for estimating LGD based on historical data and must apply **downturn adjustments** to ensure regulatory compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 How is LGD estimated?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify defaulted borrowers (only these are included in LGD modeling)  \n",
    "2. Collect recovery data (collateral, legal proceeds, payments, etc.)  \n",
    "3. Calculate LGD per exposure:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{LGD} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Recovered Amount}}{\\text{Exposure at Default (EAD)}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model recovery behavior using machine learning or regression techniques  \n",
    "5. Apply downturn adjustments to ensure conservative estimates\n",
    "\n",
    " **Note:** While LGD is often modeled via regression, other modeling strategies can also be effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree-based models** (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost) for non-linear effects  \n",
    "- **Binary classification models** for predicting high LGD cases  \n",
    "- **Two-stage models**: first model the likelihood of recovery, then model severity (LGD) conditional on recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Factors Affecting LGD\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type and value of collateral  \n",
    "- Seniority of claim  \n",
    "- Legal recovery process efficiency  \n",
    "- Macroeconomic conditions  \n",
    "- Industry and geography  \n",
    "- Borrower credit quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Example: LGD by Collateral Type\n",
    "\n",
    "| Collateral Type              | Description              | LGD (%) |\n",

    "| Unsecured consumer loans    | No collateral            | 70–90   |\n",
    "| Defaulted with no recovery  | Zero recovery            | 100     |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 LGD within the IRB Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "LGD is one of three key parameters in the IRB framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PD** – Probability of Default  \n",
    "- **LGD** – Loss Given Default  \n",
    "- **EAD** – Exposure at Default  \n",
    "\n",
    "Capital requirements are computed as a function of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Capital Requirement} = f(\\text{PD}, \\text{LGD}, \\text{EAD})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because IRB uses PiT estimates, parameters must be frequently updated and calibrated to reflect current credit quality and macroeconomic shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.7 Special Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basel imposes LGD floors for some exposures (e.g. 10% for mortgages)  \n",
    "- **Cure rate**: borrowers who recover from default may affect LGD estimation  \n",
    "- **Workout LGD** (based on actual recovery cash flows) vs **Market LGD** (based on market values)  \n",
    "- Segmentation: different LGD models may be required for different customer types (e.g. retail vs corporate)\n",

    "In this step we integrate the **PD dataset** into the **LGD dataset** and evaluate the  \n",
    "information content of the PD features with respect to default/LGD outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps performed\n",
    "1. **Normalize column names** – remove BOM characters and whitespace.  \n",
    "2. **Ensure consistent datatypes** – cast `customer_id` and `snapshot_year` to `Int64`.  \n",
    "3. **Deduplicate PD data** – drop duplicate rows on the join keys.  \n",
    "4. **Suffix PD columns** – all PD features are suffixed `_pd` (except join keys).  \n",
    "5. **Left join** – merge PD data into LGD data (`m:1` relation).  \n",
    "6. **Sanity checks** – verify number of rows, count added PD columns, and missing rates.  \n",
    "7. **Label identification** – detect a binary LGD/default label (e.g., `default_flag` or `lgd > 0`).  \n",
    "8. **Mutual Information (MI)** – compute MI between PD features and the label to  \n",
    "   identify the most predictive PD variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **Row count check**: ensures join did not alter LGD sample size.  \n",
    "- **PD column check**: lists number of new variables added and their missing rates.  \n",
    "- **Label detection**: automatic identification of a binary outcome variable.  \n",
    "- **MI ranking**: top-k PD features ranked by information gain vs. the label.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "This procedure ensures a **clean, consistent merge** between LGD and PD datasets, and provides an early indication of which PD variables contain **predictive power** for LGD modeling.  \n"

    "### 2.7 PD–LGD Matching Strategy under IRB Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB)** approach under Basel II/III, both **Probability of Default (PD)** and **Loss Given Default (LGD)** models are ideally built at the **individual exposure / counterparty level**.  \n",
    "This means that for each LGD observation, we should use PD inputs **from the exact same customer** and **the same observation period** (e.g., `snapshot_year`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Data Situation\n",
    "- Our LGD dataset contains `customer_id` and `snapshot_year`.\n",
    "- The PD dataset also contains these keys, but only **~57%** of LGD rows have a direct PD match.\n",
    "- The remaining **~43%** of LGD rows have **no matching PD record** — likely due to differences in customer coverage or data extraction scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Options for Handling Missing PD Matches\n",
    "1. **Pure IRB approach – Keep only exact matches**\n",
    "   - Retain only LGD rows that have a matching PD record (`customer_id`, `snapshot_year`).\n",
    "   - This preserves full alignment of PD and LGD for IRB-compliant modeling.\n",
    "   - Disadvantage: reduces the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid approach – Fill missing PD using portfolio-level aggregates**\n",
    "   - For rows without a direct PD match, fill missing PD features using aggregated values based on the same `snapshot_year` and `segment_type` (or other portfolio grouping).\n",
    "   - This allows retaining the full LGD dataset but introduces less precise PD estimates for imputed rows.\n",
    "   - Must flag imputed cases for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Approach\n",
    "- **For regulatory IRB calibration:**  \n",
    "  Use **only matched rows** to ensure individual-level PD–LGD alignment.\n",
    "- **For exploratory analysis or IFRS 9 / stress testing:**  \n",
    "  Consider imputing missing PD values with segment-level aggregates to preserve sample size, but always **flag and document** these imputations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual strategy allows us to remain compliant for IRB purposes while maximizing data utility for broader analytical objectives."

    "### Conclusion: LGD Distribution Summary\n",
    "After filtering the dataset to include only defaulted observations (637 cases, 31.4% of the total),  \n",
    "we examined the distribution and characteristics of the LGD (Loss Given Default) variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings:\n",
    "- LGD values are correctly bounded between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The average LGD across all defaults is approximately **52%**.\n",
    "- The distribution is fairly spread, with the 25th percentile at **29%**, median at **53%**, and 75th percentile at **77%**.\n",
    "- About one third of defaults result in relatively low losses (LGD < 30%), while another third are close to total loss (LGD > 75%).\n",
    "- The histogram shows a broad and somewhat uniform spread across the range, with slight peaks toward higher LGD values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution indicates a mix of exposures with partial recoveries and near-total losses.  \n",
    "The shape supports the use of **regression models** (continuous LGD prediction), while a **binary high/low LGD classification** could also be relevant for risk segmentation. Correlation analysis with exposure, recovery amount, and credit score will guide feature selection in subsequent modeling steps.\n"

    "## 2.10 Interpretation: LGD Exploratory Analysis (Defaulted Customers Only)\n",
    "This section provides a first look into the **Loss Given Default (LGD)** distribution and its relationship with key financial variables. The goal is to assess whether the target is suitable for modeling and to gain early insight into recovery patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Population: Defaulted Customers\n",
    "Since LGD is only defined for loans where default has occurred, we filter the dataset to defaulted cases only:\n",
    "- **637 defaulted customers** (~31.4% of the total dataset)  \n",
    "- This is a sufficient sample size for exploratory analysis and initial model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LGD Distribution\n",
    "- LGD values are correctly bounded between **0.00 and 1.00**  \n",
    "- **Mean LGD ≈ 52%**, with a **median ≈ 53%**  \n",
    "- Distribution is fairly broad:  \n",
    "  - 25th percentile ≈ 29%  \n",
    "  - 75th percentile ≈ 77%  \n",
    "- About one-third of defaults result in **low LGD (<30%)**, while another third are **high LGD (>75%)**  \n",
    "- The histogram shows a spread across the range, not dominated by full recoveries, which is realistic in mixed retail/corporate portfolios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation Matrix Insights\n",
    "- `recovered_amount` is strongly **negatively correlated** with LGD — higher recovery reduces loss.  \n",
    "- `exposure_at_default` shows a mild **positive correlation** with LGD — larger loans are somewhat harder to recover.  \n",
    "- `credit_score_internal` and `rating_grade` have weak but intuitive relationships with LGD.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### LGD by Categories\n",
    "Using grouped summaries across categorical variables (`segment_type`, `loan_purpose`, `collateral_type`, etc.):\n",
    "- Collateralized loans (`property`, `vehicle`) tend to show **lower mean LGD** compared to unsecured (`none`).  \n",
    "- Business and investment purposes show somewhat higher LGD averages than consumption or education loans.  \n",
    "- Segment-level differences (Retail vs. Corporate) are visible but not extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "- The LGD variable is **well-behaved, bounded, and statistically consistent**.  \n",
    "- Clear variation exists across loan types and collateral structures.  \n",
    "- The data is well-suited for **regression-based LGD modeling**, with potential extensions into segmentation (e.g., collateral/no-collateral) or classification (high vs. low LGD)."

    "The categorical analysis of LGD reveals meaningful but moderate variations:\n",

    "- **Loan purpose**: Renovation and consumption loans tend to have the highest LGD, while business and investment loans are somewhat lower.  \n",
    "- **Collateral type**: As expected, unsecured loans (`none`) exhibit the highest LGD (~0.54). Both property- and vehicle-backed loans reduce losses (~0.50).  \n",
    "- **Recovery type**: Almost all cases are partial recoveries with LGD ≈ 0.52; full defaults are rare but show high variability.  \n",
    "- **Customer/PD features**: Renters have higher LGD than owners/mortgage holders, and some regional/industry differences appear (e.g., services and east/north slightly higher). Marital status differences are weak.\n",

    "#### Overall\n",
    "- **Collateral** and **loan purpose** emerge as the strongest categorical LGD drivers.  \n",
    "- Most categories cluster tightly around LGD ≈ 0.50, suggesting that **continuous features** (income, exposure, credit score) may provide stronger predictive power in modeling.  \n",

    "## 2.12 LGD by Segments and Risk Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen the exploratory analysis, we assess how **Loss Given Default (LGD)** varies across both categorical and numeric drivers.  \n",
    "This step complements the overall distribution analysis by highlighting **heterogeneity across portfolios** and confirming which features are meaningful candidates for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Drivers – Boxplot Analysis\n",
    "The boxplots show that LGD distributions are broadly consistent across groups, but with some subtle patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment Type**: Retail and Corporate customers show similar LGD medians (~0.50), but Retail displays slightly higher dispersion in the upper tail.  \n",
    "- **Loan Purpose**: Renovation loans tend to have somewhat higher LGDs, while business and investment loans show slightly lower averages.  \n",
    "- **Collateral Type**: Loans with *no collateral* have visibly higher LGDs than those secured by vehicles or property, which is intuitive from a risk management perspective.  \n",
    "- **Customer Region (PD data)**: Regional differences are modest, though East/West tend to show higher median LGD compared to South.  \n",
    "- **Industry Sector (PD data)**: Service-sector loans show higher LGD, while Technology and Finance exhibit slightly lower median values.  \n",
    "- **Housing & Marital Status (PD data)**: Borrowers who rent or are divorced exhibit marginally higher LGDs, while owners and married borrowers tend to have lower losses.  \n",
    "- **Recovery Type**: By construction, full and partial recoveries overlap, but the spread of LGD is still evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Drivers – Correlation Analysis\n",
    "The correlation matrix confirms the intuitive relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recovered Amount**: Strong **negative correlation** with LGD — higher recovery reduces loss severity.  \n",
    "- **Exposure at Default (EAD)**: Moderate **positive correlation** with LGD, suggesting larger exposures are harder to fully recover.  \n",
    "- **Credit Score Internal & Rating Grade**: Weak but expected correlations with LGD — better credit quality is associated with lower LGD.  \n",
    "- **Log-transformed exposure variables** (e.g., `log_ead`) behave similarly, reinforcing exposure size as an influential driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, the exploratory results demonstrate that LGD:\n",
    "- Is influenced by **collateralization, loan purpose, and portfolio segment**,  \n",
    "- Varies across **borrower characteristics** such as housing status and industry,  \n",
    "- And is strongly tied to **recovery-related metrics** such as `recovered_amount`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide both **regulatory justification** (segmentation by Retail vs. Corporate) and **practical insights** for feature engineering in the subsequent modeling phase."

    "### Correlation Analysis: LGD vs. Key Risk Drivers\n",
    "The correlation matrix reveals several important relationships influencing Loss Given Default (LGD):\n",
    "- `recovered_amount` maintains a **strong negative correlation** with LGD (around -0.76), confirming that higher recoveries correspond to lower losses.\n",
    "- `exposure_at_default` shows a **moderate positive correlation** with LGD (~0.44), indicating larger exposures are generally associated with higher losses.\n",
    "- `credit_score_internal` and `rating_grade` exhibit **weak negative correlations** with LGD, reflecting that better credit quality tends to reduce loss severity.\n",
    "- Additional variables such as `loan_size_bucket` and `log_ead` also show moderate positive correlations with LGD, suggesting exposure size metrics are influential.\n",
    "- The `recovery_type_code` appears with **low or no significant correlation** with LGD, implying that this categorical recovery classification may capture complementary information not fully reflected in LGD variation.\n",
    "- The strong correlations between `lgd`, `recovered_amount`, and exposure-related variables support their selection as key predictors in LGD modeling.\n",
    "These findings align well with credit risk theory and highlight the importance of recovery amounts and exposure metrics in predicting loss severity. They provide a robust foundation for feature selection and further modeling efforts."

    "### LGD Modeling Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Variable\n",
    "- LGD is defined as:  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{LGD} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Recovered Amount}}{\\text{Exposure at Default}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- Values must be bounded between **0 and 1**, with clipping or filtering as needed.  \n",
    "- Model training should include **only defaulted customers** (`default_flag == 1`).  \n",
    "- Multiple rows per customer-year may reflect **separate loans**, not duplicates. LGD should therefore be computed at the loan level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Use numerical features such as `exposure_at_default`, `credit_score_internal`, `loan_term`, etc.  \n",
    "- Encode categorical variables (`segment_type_code`, `loan_purpose_code`, `collateral_type_code`, etc.).  \n",
    "- Incorporate **PD features** (columns ending in `_pd`) to link credit risk with recovery expectations.  \n",
    "- Consider new engineered features such as `recovery_type_code` for predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Quality Checks\n",
    "- Identify and handle rows with missing or inconsistent data (e.g., zero exposure).  \n",
    "- Ensure LGD values remain within valid bounds.  \n",
    "- Check for segment-level consistency (retail vs corporate, secured vs unsecured).  \n",
    "- Validate that multiple loans per customer are correctly represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Selection\n",
    "- **Linear Regression (OLS)** for interpretability and baseline performance.  \n",
    "- **Beta Regression** for bounded continuous targets.  \n",
    "- **Tree-based models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) for capturing non-linearities and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation\n",
    "- Regression metrics: **$R^2$**, **RMSE**, **MAE**.  \n",
    "- Residual diagnostics for heteroskedasticity or misspecification.  \n",
    "- Calibration curves to validate prediction accuracy across LGD ranges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regulatory Context (Basel II/III and IFRS 9)\n",
    "- LGD must be **downturn-adjusted** to reflect stressed scenarios.  \n",
    "- Segment models by exposure type, geography, and collateral type.  \n",
    "- Ensure **consistency across PD, LGD, and EAD models** for IRB compliance.  \n",
    "- Perform validation, benchmarking, and stability testing to satisfy regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In summary, LGD modeling requires careful handling of duplicates (multiple loans per customer), integration of PD features, proper segmentation, and regulatory alignment. These considerations ensure that the resulting models are robust, interpretable, and compliant.\n"

    "## 2.15 Data Preparation and Cleaning\n",
    "Before modeling, it is crucial to ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and model-ready. This includes:\n",
    "- Handling missing values  \n",
    "- Removing duplicates  \n",
    "- Encoding categorical variables  \n",
    "- Checking for outliers  \n",
    "- Scaling numerical features where appropriate  \n",

    "A standard approach is to use `.isnull().sum()` to count missing (NaN) values per column. When interpreting the results:\n",
    "- `0.0` indicates 0% missing, meaning there are no null values in that column  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications for This Dataset\n",
    "- Our exploratory checks confirmed that **LGD values are well-behaved**: bounded in [0,1], with meaningful variation across loan purposes, collateral, and customer segments.  \n",
    "- This supports the use of both **regression models** (for continuous LGD prediction) and **segmented approaches** (e.g., Retail vs Corporate).  \n",
    "- Since regulatory frameworks require **portfolio homogeneity**, we will in the next step (Section 2.12) analyze LGD distributions across key drivers and prepare **separate modeling datasets**.  \n"

    "## 2.16 Multiple Loans per Customer – Important in LGD Modeling\n",
    "In LGD modeling (Loss Given Default), it is common that the **same customer has several loans in the same snapshot year**.  \n",

    "## 2.19 LGD Data Split – Secured vs. Unsecured\n",
    "From the filtered dataset of **defaulted exposures (n = 637)** we observe a natural split:\n",
    "- **Secured exposures:** 415 (65.1%)  \n",
    "- **Unsecured exposures:** 222 (34.9%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key observations\n",
    "- **LGD distributions:**  \n",
    "  - Secured exposures show a slightly **higher mean LGD (0.51)** compared to unsecured (0.48).  \n",
    "  - Both groups span the full 0–1 range, with medians around 0.45–0.53, but secured loans display a **wider interquartile range** (0.24–0.79).  \n",
    "- **Exposure levels:**  \n",
    "  - Secured loans tend to have higher and more variable `exposure_at_default`.  \n",
    "  - Unsecured loans, while somewhat smaller on average, still extend into high exposure values.  \n",
    "- **Recoveries:**  \n",
    "  - Median recovery amounts are comparable across both groups, suggesting that collateral improves recovery **probability**, but not necessarily recovery **magnitude**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for modeling\n",
    "- The **heterogeneity between secured and unsecured loans** supports the decision to train **separate sub-models**.  \n",
    "- Feature sets remain aligned across both groups, though sample sizes differ (**415 vs 222**).  \n",
    "  - This is acceptable for regression-based LGD modeling (e.g., OLS, Random Forest, XGBoost).  \n",
    "  - **Logistic regression is not appropriate here**, since LGD is a *continuous outcome*. Logistic regression is for binary targets like PD.  \n",
    "- For LGD, ensure the chosen model can handle **continuous, bounded targets (0–1)**. Options:  \n",
    "  - OLS (baseline, easy interpretability)  \n",
    "  - Beta regression (statistically well-suited for 0–1 data)  \n",
    "  - Tree-based models (non-linear effects, interactions)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Splitting by collateral status provides cleaner signal and prevents the model from mixing structurally different loss patterns.  \n",
    "Although sample sizes differ, this does **not pose a problem for regression** as long as evaluation is done separately per sub-model.  \n",
    "Care must be taken to **not apply logistic regression** directly on LGD; instead, regression methods that fit continuous targets should be used.\n"

    "In LGD modeling, each observation is meant to represent a **unique default event** for a customer within a given observation window (per year). However, in real-world or synthetic datasets, it is common to encounter multiple rows per customer-year combination, even though they all correspond to the **same default event**.\n",

    "- **Bias regression results** by making the model \"learn\" from artificially inflated sample sizes\n",
    "- **Violate IRB modeling principles**, which require one record per default event\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the correct approach?\n",
    "Each customer should have **only one row per default event per snapshot year**. If multiple rows exist, they must be **aggregated** before modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sum the `recovered_amount` across all rows (total amount recovered after default)\n",
    "- Use the first value (or consistent value) for static fields like `exposure_at_default`, `credit_score_internal`, and similar\n",
    "- Recalculate LGD using the updated formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{LGD} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Total Recovered Amount}}{\\text{Exposure at Default}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does the code do?\n",
    "The Python code performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filters the dataset** to include only customers who defaulted (`default_flag == 1`)\n",
    "2. **Groups the data** by `customer_id` and `snapshot_year` to identify duplicates\n",
    "3. **Aggregates values**:\n",
    "   - `recovered_amount`: summed (total recovery for that event)\n",
    "   - `exposure_at_default` and other features: first value taken (assumed consistent across rows)\n",
    "4. **Recalculates recovery rate and LGD** after aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens if you do not fix this?\n",
    "- The LGD model will treat each partial recovery as a separate default\n",
    "- Exposure amounts will be effectively duplicated, misleading the model\n",
    "- Model accuracy will suffer, especially in loss calibration and backtesting\n",
    "- Regulatory or internal validation will likely **reject** the model due to data integrity issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "> Aggregation of duplicated default rows is a critical step in preparing LGD modeling data. It ensures that each observation accurately reflects a single, complete default event and that loss severity is calculated consistently and fairly across the portfolio.\n"

    "Based on the preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis conducted:\n",
    "- **Feature Preparation:**  \n",
    "  The key features have been successfully transformed and prepared for modeling. Log transformations of `exposure_at_default` and `annual_income` helped reduce skewness and improve feature distribution. Binning `credit_score_internal` into quintiles simplified the variable while capturing important nonlinear effects. Additional categorical variables were encoded into numeric formats for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics:**  \n",
    "  The descriptive statistics indicate stable and reasonable distributions across features. Numeric features show expected ranges and percentiles, while categorical codes are well represented across their categories without missing values.\n",
    "- **Distribution Visualizations:**  \n",
    "  Histograms reveal mostly well-behaved feature distributions:\n",
    "  - `log_ead` and `log_income` show approximately normal distributions after log transformation.  \n",
    "  - Categorical variables display expected counts per category, confirming good encoding and data integrity.  \n",
    "  - The target variable `lgd` is right-skewed as anticipated, consistent with typical loss given default distributions.\n",
    "Overall, the dataset is clean, transformed, and ready for robust LGD model development with a good balance of numeric and categorical predictors."

    "### Handling of Outliers in Recovered Amount\n",
    "During the analysis of recovered amounts, we observed that a few data points have unusually high values compared to the rest of the population. These extreme values can negatively affect our model by:\n",
    "- Distorting regression coefficients, making the model less representative of the majority of cases\n",
    "- Increasing variance and reducing the model’s generalizability\n",
    "- Giving disproportionate influence to individual observations during training\n",
    "To mitigate this and achieve a more robust model, we apply **winsorization** to the recovered amounts. Winsorization involves capping values outside a certain percentile range (e.g., 1st and 99th percentiles) to those threshold values. By doing this, we retain all observations but reduce the impact of outliers that could otherwise skew the model's learning and predictions. After winsorization, we recalculate the recovery rate and LGD to obtain a more stable and realistic target variable. This approach is commonly used in credit risk modeling, where extreme values are frequent, and it helps to improve both the model's performance and interpretability."

    "In LGD modeling, several modeling approaches exist depending on the specific focus and granularity required. The main types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree-based Models**  \n",
    "  These models can handle multiple levels (e.g., product segmentation or loan size buckets) and capture complex interactions in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression Models**  \n",
    "  Standard regression models predict LGD as a continuous outcome and serve as a solid baseline for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logit Models on Binary LGD**  \n",
    "  These models treat LGD as a binary variable (e.g., above or below a threshold) to capture the probability of high loss severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logit Models on LGD Components**  \n",
    "  Models that focus on parts of the LGD calculation such as cure rate (recovery after default) or loss given loss, allowing more granular modeling of recovery behavior.\n",

    "- **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** performed similarly, with R² ≈ 0.21.  \n",

    "- The error metrics (MAE and RMSE) are close across all models, indicating stable but modest predictive performance.  \n",

    "- The predicted values follow a generally monotonic increasing trend, as expected, indicating that the model is able to rank-order LGD risk reasonably well.  \n",
    "- The calibration curve of predicted LGD is smoother than the actual LGD, which shows more variability across bins.  \n",
    "- In the lower bins (0–2), the model **overestimates LGD** compared to observed values.  \n",

    "## 3.4 Advanced LGD Modeling Alternatives: Multilevel Tree Models\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "LGD behavior is often heterogeneous across portfolio strata such as product type, exposure size, segment (retail vs corporate), region, and collateral. Standard single-model regressions can miss these layered effects. Multilevel (hierarchical) tree approaches partition the portfolio into meaningful subpopulations and learn patterns within each, improving fit and interpretability at operational granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the approach does\n",
    "- **Structured segmentation:** Split the portfolio by high-signal cuts (e.g., segment → loan size bucket → collateral), learned by the model or defined by business rules.\n",
    "- **Local pattern learning:** Within each node, tree ensembles (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) capture non-linearities and interactions without manual feature crosses.\n",
    "- **Heterogeneity capture:** Different depth/structure per branch naturally reflects varying LGD drivers across products and segments.\n",
    "- **Calibrated outputs:** Node-level post-calibration (e.g., isotonic regression) aligns predicted and observed LGD by segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use\n",
    "- Clear heterogeneity across products, sizes, segments, or regions.\n",
    "- Rich categorical features and interactions suspected to matter.\n",
    "- Need for segment-level insight, monitoring, and governance (IRB/IFRS 9 contexts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical blueprint\n",
    "1. **Pre-segmentation (optional):** Define coarse groups (e.g., {Retail, Corporate} × EAD buckets × collateral presence).\n",
    "2. **Model per branch or hierarchical tree:**  \n",
    "   - Option A: Train a separate tree ensemble per branch.  \n",
    "   - Option B: Train a single gradient-boosted tree with the segmentation features and allow the model to discover splits.\n",
    "3. **Calibration:** Apply bin-wise calibration per branch (isotonic or Platt-style) to correct systematic bias.\n",
    "4. **Validation:** Report metrics by branch (R², MAE, RMSE), calibration plots, and stability across time windows.\n",
    "5. **Governance:** Maintain feature importance and partial dependence by branch for explainability and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected benefits and trade-offs\n",
    "- **Benefits:** Better fit on heterogeneous portfolios, clearer risk drivers per segment, improved calibration at the edges.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:** More artifacts to manage (per-branch models or deeper trees), careful monitoring to prevent overfitting, and the need for branch-level performance tracking.\n"

    "## XGBoost LGD Evaluation – Test Set\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Evaluate the XGBoost model on the held-out test set using two complementary diagnostics:\n",
    "1. **Predicted vs Actual scatter** – to check alignment and dispersion  \n",
    "2. **Binned calibration plot** – to assess calibration across the prediction range  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. Reconstructed the exact test matrices from the same split as training to avoid leakage or index drift.  \n",
    "2. Ensured feature alignment with the model’s training set; applied scaling for linear models (not needed here).  \n",
    "3. Generated predictions and clipped them to [0,1] to respect the LGD domain.  \n",
    "4. Built calibration bins (deciles) and compared mean predicted LGD against mean observed LGD.  \n",
    "5. Produced two plots:  \n",
    "   - Scatter with y = x reference line  \n",
    "   - Calibration curve by prediction decile  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "- **Prediction–Actual Alignment**:  \n",
    "  Predictions capture the general trend but scatter widely around the diagonal. Extreme LGD values are poorly reproduced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calibration**:  \n",
    "  Predicted LGDs increase monotonically across deciles (ranking signal preserved).  \n",
    "  However, systematic bias is present:  \n",
    "  - **Low LGD**: overestimation  \n",
    "  - **High LGD**: underestimation followed by overshooting at the top decile  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variability Capture**:  \n",
    "  Actual LGD shows much higher within-bin variability than the smooth prediction curve, indicating **underfitting**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "- Model is useful for **relative ranking** of exposures but unreliable for precise case-level LGD estimates.  \n",
    "- Portfolio averages may be acceptable, but calibration adjustments (e.g. isotonic regression, Platt scaling) are needed.  \n",
    "- Current performance (R² ≈ 0.44) reflects directional learning but not sufficient explanatory power.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Expand feature set (secured vs unsecured, exposure size buckets, interaction terms).  \n",
    "2. Tune hyperparameters with calibration metrics in validation.  \n",
    "3. Test multilevel tree models or ensemble variants for segment-specific performance.  \n",
    "4. Apply post-processing calibration to improve absolute prediction accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "In its current form, the XGBoost model is a **baseline**. It demonstrates monotonic risk ordering but is **not production-ready** for LGD estimation without further calibration and feature engineering.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Why a Distribution-Aware Approach for LGD?\n",
    "Loss Given Default (LGD) is bounded in **[0,1]** and often exhibits **spikes at 0** (full recovery) and sometimes **near 1** (no recovery).  \n",
    "Standard regressors (e.g., OLS, plain trees) ignore this bounded and zero-inflated structure, which can lead to biased estimates and poor calibration—especially in the tails.  \n",

    "1. The probability of *any* loss ($LGD > 0$), and  \n",
    "2. The **conditional LGD** on $(0,1]$, using a distribution that respects the bounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup improves both **rank ordering** and **absolute calibration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "- **Part A – Occurrence model (classifier):**  \n",
    "  Predicts $ \\Pr(LGD > 0 \\mid X) $ using e.g. Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or LightGBM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part B – Severity model (regressor):**  \n",
    "  Fits LGD only on non-zero cases, after mapping values to $(0,1)$. Options include:  \n",
    "  - Beta regression (logit link on mean),  \n",
    "  - Tree-based models on logit-transformed LGD,  \n",
    "  - Quantile GBM to capture conditional quantiles ($p_{10}, p_{50}, p_{90}$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combine:**  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\hat{LGD} = \\hat{p}(LGD > 0) \\times \\widehat{LGD \\mid LGD > 0}\n",
    "  $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calibrate:**  \n",
    "  Apply isotonic or Platt scaling to the classifier, and bin-wise scaling or isotonic regression for the severity part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Apply\n",
    "- LGD distribution shows **mass at zero** or **fat tails** near 1.  \n",
    "- Calibration is critical (e.g., IFRS9/IRB provisioning).  \n",
    "- Portfolio exhibits strong heterogeneity by product, collateral, or loan size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Tips\n",
    "- Use **train-only binning** for engineered features (e.g., exposure buckets) to avoid leakage.  \n",
    "- Preserve true zeros for Part A; apply clipping/de-zero only for Part B.  \n",
    "- Consider **monotonic constraints** for expert features (e.g., worse rating → higher LGD) when using GBMs.  \n",
    "- Evaluate with calibration curves, **Brier score** (Part A), and MAE/RMSE plus **tail bias checks** (Part B)."

    "### Conclusion – Two-Stage LGD (Cure × Severity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-stage LGD framework — separating **cure probability** and **loss severity conditional on loss** — was successfully implemented to reflect the bounded and zero-inflated nature of LGD.  \n",
    "Current results, however, indicate limited predictive performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combined R²:** -0.486 (worse than a naïve mean predictor)  \n",
    "- **MAE:** 0.283  \n",
    "- **RMSE:** 0.355  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibration Insights\n",
    "- Predicted LGD increases monotonically across deciles, but **actual LGD values vary strongly** and deviate from the predicted curve.  \n",
    "- In the **lowest decile**, predicted LGD ≈ 0.09 vs. actual LGD ≈ 0.65 → severe **underestimation of losses** in cure-like cases.  \n",
    "- **Mid and upper deciles** show closer alignment but remain unstable due to sample size and portfolio heterogeneity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- The framework is **methodologically correct and IRK-aligned** (consistent split, loss-only severity training, proper recombination).  \n",
    "- The **negative R²** highlights that the current feature set and cure threshold do not sufficiently explain LGD variation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement areas:**\n",
    "1. Experiment with alternative **cure thresholds** (e.g. 2% or 5%).  \n",
    "2. Enrich the **feature set** (collateral type, product type, macroeconomic indicators).  \n",
    "3. Replace Random Forest with **gradient boosting models** (e.g., LightGBM/XGBoost) for severity.  \n",
    "4. Apply **calibration** (Platt scaling, isotonic regression) to the cure probability model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:**  \n",
    "The two-stage cure × severity approach provides a solid conceptual foundation, but stronger features, refined thresholds, and more powerful models are required for reliable LGD predictions in this dataset.\n"

    "  Stability differs by segment: Segment 2 shows better fit ($R^2=0.218$) than Segment 3 ($R^2=0.046$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest**  \n",
    "  Performs best among the tested models with $R^2 \\approx 0.23$ overall, lower MAE ($\\approx 0.236$), and segment-level improvements (Segment 2: $R^2=0.331$ vs Segment 3: $R^2=0.074$).  \n",
    "  Suggests stronger ability to capture nonlinearities, though still heterogeneous across segments.  \n",

    "  Underperforms relative to Random Forest despite similar flexibility, with $R^2 \\approx 0.10$ overall and weak segment-level stability.  \n",
    "  Indicates possible overfitting or suboptimal hyperparameters.  \n",

    "  This is expected: the model is designed for **binary classification**, not regression-style LGD prediction.  \n",
    "  Its inclusion here underlines that such binary logit models should only be evaluated with classification metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1), not regression diagnostics.  \n",

    "- **Random Forest is the most stable and accurate model** across both overall and segment-level diagnostics.  \n",
    "- **Linear Regression provides a simple but limited baseline**, more stable in Segment 2 than Segment 3.  \n",
    "- **XGBoost requires tuning** (e.g., regularization, learning rate, tree depth) to avoid underperformance.  \n",
    "- **Binary logit models should be treated separately**, as their role is classification rather than regression calibration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recommendation:** Use Random Forest as the main LGD severity model, monitor segment-level differences (especially Segment 3), and refine XGBoost through hyperparameter optimization. Retain logistic models only for binary risk-flagging tasks.\n"

Predictions do not improve upon a naive mean predictor.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Downturn LGD Considerations\n",
    "To ensure conservatism in line with **CRR Article 181(1)(b)**, the framework applies a **20% uplift** to predicted LGD values to simulate downturn conditions.  \n",
    "- This adjustment captures adverse macroeconomic stress.  \n",

    "- The impact of this uplift is quantified at the portfolio level, ensuring capital adequacy under downturn scenarios.  \n",

    "### 5.3 Model Governance Recommendations\n",
    "To maintain compliance and reliability over time, the following governance practices are recommended:  \n",
    "- **Ongoing monitoring** of predictive performance (R², RMSE, MAE), as well as input feature distributions, at least quarterly.  \n",
    "- **Retraining** the model at least annually, or sooner if material portfolio or macroeconomic shifts are observed.  \n",
    "- **Independent validation** in accordance with internal risk policies, with clear documentation of approvals and model versioning.  \n",
